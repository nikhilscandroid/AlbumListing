# AlbumListing
App displays albums list sorted by title, It uses  ViewModel, Room DB for offline support.

Improvments can be done:
1) Use of SyncAdapter
    Sync adapter can be used as a improvement because it Synchronizes data between an Android device and web servers can make application significantly more useful and compelling for users
    and transferring data from a server makes it available to the user even when the device is offline .

 

2) Mockito
Mockito can be used to write unit tests that require dependency mocking without all the extra boiler plate code associated with manually creating mock dependencies.

 

3) RX JAVA
 Rx Java can we easily define what thread each part of the chain would be in  . subscribeOn() to define the default thread. observerOn() to define what the bottom chain thread will be work on
 Rotation of device is also consider configuration change that need to kill and restart the activity.
 RxJava (2.0), upon subscription, it will return a disposable object we can use this disposable value stored and use it to terminate the entire process when needed.
